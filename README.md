Overview For project #2, I created a Photography Company Event and inventory for the company's management and staff to keep track of upcoming events and equipment for event. 

The company's staff photographers can create, view, update and delete Profiles, Events and equipment. They can also print or export lists of staff, events or equipment by right clicking on the list and selecting print.

Before starting this project, I prepared my background with extensive use of Photoshop by adding about 36 different layers of equipment images to the shelves of the empty red closet. Then added two sets of doors to the index page and created a slide animation to open the doors on a 3s delay.
